This is the Resolume fork of the FFGL repository. It is up to date and has Visual Studio and Xcode projects to compile 32 bit and 64 bit plugins.

This FFGL 2.0 branch contains the 2.0 version of the FFGL SDK. It is the state the SDK was in when we released it to provide support for FFGL plugins inside Resolume 7. If you want to use the latest development version with the most recent fixes and features you should use the master branch.

To compile plugins for hosts that support FFGL 1.6 (Resolume 6, VDMX, COGE, Isadora, Magic Music Visuals), switch to the FFGL1.6 branch: https://github.com/resolume/ffgl/tree/ffgl1.6

You can find some help to get started with FFGL plugin development on the [wiki](https://github.com/resolume/ffgl/wiki).

Also more examples are available on this [repo](https://github.com/flyingrub/ffgl/tree/more/).
